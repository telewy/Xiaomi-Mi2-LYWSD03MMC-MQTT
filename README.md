# Xiaomi-Mi2-LYWSD03MMC-MQTT
Simple script for getting values of temperature, humidity and battery level from Xiaomi LYWSD03MMC sensors and sending data to Domoticz using MQTT topics. The script is based on source code from this repository https://github.com/alive-corpse/LYWSD02-LYWSD03MMC-MQTT and adapted to my needs.
